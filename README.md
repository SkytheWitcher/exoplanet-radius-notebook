# Exoplanet Radius Predictor

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict exoplanet radii based on NASA's exoplanet dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate model for estimating the size of exoplanets using available astronomical data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:

1. Clean and preprocess NASA's exoplanet dataset
2. Implement and compare multiple machine learning algorithms
3. Identify the most accurate model for predicting exoplanet radii

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from NASA's exoplanet archive. The original dataset is available as a CSV file containing various features of known exoplanets.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw NASA dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the quality and reliability of our input data.

2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features were selected based on their potential impact on exoplanet radius prediction.

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Several machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared, including (but not limited to):
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared value.

5. **Model Selection**: The most accurate model was selected based on the evaluation results.
